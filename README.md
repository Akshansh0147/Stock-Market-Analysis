Stock Market Prediction is one one the most widely opted projects in Data Analytics. The special thing about Stock Market Prediction is that it is the most basic problem in Machine Learning but in Deep Learning, it becomes one of the most challenging problems. That comes due to special characteristics of a stock market. So, I'll discuss in detail possibly all the approaches that are used in stock predictions:
Regression using scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
Artificial Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
Recurrent Neural Network-LSTM (Deep Learning) I've used 5-year Google Stock market dataset to train the models.
